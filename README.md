# Playing Risk

A week or so ago someone playing [Risk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128810) appered in my YouTube feed.
I didn't realise such a thing existed and since it happened to be on sale, I droped the $7 to try it out.
Turns out that I was really missing out on something fun from my child hood.

After playing for a while I wanted to bring some of my expertese to see if I can win faster.
The first thing I did was a lit review, so I headed over to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)).
Turns out that there is even a [campain planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)#cite_note-14) already built.
Too bad it links to the [Wayback Machiene](https://web.archive.org/web/20150208181409/http://armsrace.plynd.com/probabilities) and the origional link does not exist.

So I hopped over to [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).
Do not put in the word "Risk" first, you will get the wrong type of results and it is not fun to sort through everything.
After a while I came accross a 1997 paper by [Baris Tan](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~btan/PDF/JournalArticles/MMrisk97.pdf).
Reading the math is hard, so the TLDR ir this: Attack with 2x the defender, expect to lose half-ish.

I am not super happy with the results of my review for two reasones:

1. I want more information at low levels.
   The paper looks at 5, 10, 15, ... 30.
3. I want to see the campain plan.
   Not looking one or two moves ahead causes a great deal of issues.
